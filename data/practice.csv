Closed-form Marginal Likelihood in Gamma-Poisson Matrix Factorization,  We present novel understandings of the Gamma-Poisson (GaP) model  a probabilistic matrix factorization model for count data  We show that GaP can be rewritten free of the score/activation matrix  This gives us new insights about the estimation of the topic/dictionary matrix by maximum marginal likelihood estimation  In particular  this explains the robustness of this estimator to over-specified values of the factorization rank  especially its ability to automatically prune irrelevant dictionary columns  as empirically observed in previous work  The marginalization of the activation matrix leads in turn to a new Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm with favorable properties  
Laboratory mid-IR spectra of equilibrated and igneous meteorites  Searching for observables of planetesimal debris,  Meteorites contain minerals from Solar System asteroids with different properties (like size  presence of water  core formation)  We provide new mid-IR transmission spectra of powdered meteorites to obtain templates of how mid-IR spectra of asteroidal debris would look like  This is essential for interpreting mid-IR spectra of past and future space observatories  like the James Webb Space Telescope  We show that the transmission spectra of wet and dry chondrites  carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites and achondrite and chondrite meteorites are distinctly different in a way one can distinguish in astronomical mid-IR spectra  The two observables that spectroscopically separate the different meteorites groups (and thus the different types of parent bodies) are the pyroxene-olivine feature strength ratio and the peak shift of the olivine spectral features due to an increase in the iron concentration of the olivine  
Case For Static AMSDU Aggregation in WLANs,  Frame aggregation is a mechanism by which multiple frames are combined into a single transmission unit over the air  Frames aggregated at the AMSDU level use a common CRC check to enforce integrity  For longer aggregated AMSDU frames  the packet error rate increases significantly for the same bit error rate  Hence  multiple studies have proposed doing AMSDU aggregation adaptively based on the error rate  This study evaluates if there is a \emph{practical} advantage in doing adaptive AMSDU aggregation based on the link bit error rate  Evaluations on a model show that instead of implementing a complex adaptive AMSDU frame aggregation mechanism which impact queuing and other implementation aspects  it is easier to influence packet error rate with traditional mechanisms while keeping the AMSDU aggregation logic simple  
The $Gaia$-ESO Survey: the inner disk intermediate-age open cluster NGC 6802,Milky Way open clusters are very diverse in terms of age  chemical composition  and kinematic properties  Intermediate-age and old open clusters are less common  and it is even harder to find them inside the solar Galactocentric radius  due to the high mortality rate and strong extinction inside this region  NGC 6802 is one of the inner disk open clusters (IOCs) observed by the $Gaia$-ESO survey (GES)  This cluster is an important target for calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and chemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters  Using the measurements from $Gaia$-ESO internal data release 4 (iDR4)  we identify 95 main-sequence dwarfs as cluster members from the GIRAFFE target list  and eight giants as cluster members from the UVES target list  The dwarf cluster members have a median radial velocity of $13 6\pm1 9$ km s$^{-1}$  while the giant cluster members have a median radial velocity of $12 0\pm0 9$ km s$^{-1}$ and a median [Fe/H] of $0 10\pm0 02$ dex  The color-magnitude diagram of these cluster members suggests an age of $0 9\pm0 1$ Gyr  with $(m-M)_0=11 4$ and $E(B-V)=0 86$  We perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of NGC 6802  including 27 elemental species  To gain a more general picture about IOCs  the measurements of NGC 6802 are compared with those of other IOCs previously studied by GES  that is  NGC 4815  Trumpler 20  NGC 6705  and Berkeley 81  NGC 6802 shows similar C  N  Na  and Al abundances as other IOCs  These elements are compared with nucleosynthetic models as a function of cluster turn-off mass  The $\alpha$  iron-peak  and neutron-capture elements are also explored in a self-consistent way 
Witness-Functions versus Interpretation-Functions for Secrecy in Cryptographic Protocols: What to Choose?,  Proving that a cryptographic protocol is correct for secrecy is a hard task  One of the strongest strategies to reach this goal is to show that it is increasing  which means that the security level of every single atomic message exchanged in the protocol  safely evaluated  never deceases  Recently  two families of functions have been proposed to measure the security level of atomic messages  The first one is the family of interpretation-functions  The second is the family of witness-functions  In this paper  we show that the witness-functions are more efficient than interpretation-functions  We give a detailed analysis of an ad-hoc protocol on which the witness-functions succeed in proving its correctness for secrecy while the interpretation-functions fail to do so  
Pairwise Difference Estimation of High Dimensional Partially Linear Model,This paper proposes a regularized pairwise difference approach for estimating the linear component coefficient in a partially linear model  with consistency and exact rates of convergence obtained in high dimensions under mild scaling requirements  Our analysis reveals interesting features such as (i) the bandwidth parameter automatically adapts to the model and is actually tuning-insensitive and (ii) the procedure could even maintain fast rate of convergence for $\alpha$-Hölder class of $\alpha\leq1/2$  Simulation studies show the advantage of the proposed method  and application of our approach to a brain imaging data reveals some biological patterns which fail to be recovered using competing methods 
Dissecting the multivariate extremal index and tail dependence,  A central issue in the theory of extreme values focuses on suitable conditions such that the well-known results for the limiting distributions of the maximum of i i d  sequences can be applied to stationary ones  In this context  the extremal index appears as a key parameter to capture the effect of temporal dependence on the limiting distribution of the maxima  The multivariate extremal index corresponds to a generalization of this concept to a multivariate context and affects the tail dependence structure within the marginal sequences and between them  As it is a function  the inference becomes more difficult  and it is therefore important to obtain characterizations  namely bounds based on the marginal dependence that are easier to estimate  In this work we present two decompositions that emphasize different types of information contained in the multivariate extremal index  an upper limit better than those found in the literature and we analyze its role in dependence on the limiting model of the componentwise maxima of a stationary sequence  We will illustrate the results with examples of recognized interest in applications  
Big Universe  Big Data: Machine Learning and Image Analysis for Astronomy,  Astrophysics and cosmology are rich with data  The advent of wide-area digital cameras on large aperture telescopes has led to ever more ambitious surveys of the sky  Data volumes of entire surveys a decade ago can now be acquired in a single night and real-time analysis is often desired  Thus  modern astronomy requires big data know-how  in particular it demands highly efficient machine learning and image analysis algorithms  But scalability is not the only challenge: Astronomy applications touch several current machine learning research questions  such as learning from biased data and dealing with label and measurement noise  We argue that this makes astronomy a great domain for computer science research  as it pushes the boundaries of data analysis  In the following  we will present this exciting application area for data scientists  We will focus on exemplary results  discuss main challenges  and highlight some recent methodological advancements in machine learning and image analysis triggered by astronomical applications  
Natural Language Does Not Emerge 'Naturally' in Multi-Agent Dialog,  A number of recent works have proposed techniques for end-to-end learning of communication protocols among cooperative multi-agent populations  and have simultaneously found the emergence of grounded human-interpretable language in the protocols developed by the agents  all learned without any human supervision! In this paper  using a Task and Tell reference game between two agents as a testbed  we present a sequence of 'negative' results culminating in a 'positive' one -- showing that while most agent-invented languages are effective (i e  achieve near-perfect task rewards)  they are decidedly not interpretable or compositional  In essence  we find that natural language does not emerge 'naturally'  despite the semblance of ease of natural-language-emergence that one may gather from recent literature  We discuss how it is possible to coax the invented languages to become more and more human-like and compositional by increasing restrictions on how two agents may communicate  
Properties and Origin of Galaxy Velocity Bias in the Illustris Simulation,We use the hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations from the Illustris suite to study the origin and properties of galaxy velocity bias  i e   the difference between the velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter inside halos  We find that galaxy velocity bias is a decreasing function of the ratio of galaxy stellar mass to host halo mass  In general  central galaxies are not at rest with respect to dark matter halos or the core of halos  with a velocity dispersion above 0 04 times that of the dark matter  The central galaxy velocity bias is found to be mostly caused by the close interactions between the central and satellite galaxies  For satellite galaxies  the velocity bias is related to their dynamical and tidal evolution history after being accreted onto the host halos  It depends on the time after the accretion and their distances from the halo centers  with massive satellites generally moving more slowly than the dark matter  The results are in broad agreements with those inferred from modeling small-scale redshift-space galaxy clustering data  and the study can help improve models of redshift-space galaxy clustering 
Computer Modeling of Halogen Bonds and Other $σ$-Hole Interactions,In the field of noncovalent interactions a new paradigm has recently become popular  It stems from the analysis of molecular electrostatic potentials and introduces a label  which has recently attracted enormous attention  The label is {\sigma}-hole  and it was first used in connection with halogens  It initiated a renaissance of interest in halogenated compounds  and later on  when found also on other groups of atoms (chalcogens  pnicogens  tetrels and aerogens)  it resulted in a new direction of research of intermolecular interactions  In this review  we summarize advances from about the last 10 years in understanding those interactions related to {\sigma}-hole  We pay particular attention to theoretical and computational techniques  which play a crucial role in the field
